#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANSWER: 
Software Engineering is defined as an orderly and structured approach to the cycle of developing, operating and maintaining a software. It applies the system of engineering to the making of software.
Software Engineering is important because it helps provide frameworks and methodologies needed to manage complex products, also to ensure that software systems are robust, also dependable;reducing the risk of failures. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANSWER:
1. In the late 1960s, the software industry faced a "software crisis". Projects were constantly way over budget, behind schedule, and most often failed to meet the requirements. This so led to a system were software development needed a more structured and systematic approach. The term "Software Engineering" was formed at 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, thereby the beginning of the field as a distinct discipline. It emphaised the need for applying engineering principles to software development, focusing on reliability and cost-effectiveness.
2. This period is between 1970-1980, This era saw the emergence of structured programming and methodologies like the Waterfall model. This emphasized top-down programming,and the use of control structures to improve code clarity.  These advancements brought more discipline and rigor to the development process. They provided the Waterfall model has limitations, it laid the foundation for subsequent methodologies.
3. This period is between late 1990s- Present. In the late 1990s, the Agile movement emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, heavyweight methodologies. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming(XP), emphasized iterative development, collaboration and rapid feedback .DevOps further extended Agile principles by focusing on the integration of development and operations and promoting continuous delivery. Agile and DevOps have transformed the way software is developed and delivered. Faster developement cycles, improved responsive to changing requirements, have been enabled over the years. These approaches are crucial for meeting the meeting the demands of today's fast-paced and dynamic software industry.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning/Requirements Gathering: This is the initial phase where the project's goals, scope, and requirements are defined. It involves gathering information from stakeholders, analyzing user needs, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. This mostly would involve; Feasibility studies, requirements elicitation, documentation, and defining project scope.
2. Analysis/Design: In this phase, the requirements gathered in the previous phase are analyzed in detail. The system's architecture, data models, and user interfaces are designed. This phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the software. This stage involves; Creating design documents, data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and user interface mockups.
3. Implementation/Development: This is where the actual coding of the software takes place. Developers write the code based on the design specifications created in the previous phase. This pha eis focused on; Writing code, unit testing, and integrating different modules of the software.
4. Testing
 * Explanation: The developed software is thoroughly tested to identify and fix any defects or bugs. Various testing methods are employed, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
 * Key Activities: Writing test cases, executing tests, and logging and fixing bugs.
5. Deployment
 * Explanation: Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed or released to the production environment. This makes the software available for end-users.
 * Key Activities: Installation, configuration, and user training.
6. Maintenance
 * Explanation: This phase involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software after it has been deployed. It includes fixing bugs, releasing updates, and adding new featuresx as needed.
 * Key Activities: Bug fixing, performance monitoring, and releasing software updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Just like a recipe, do all of the steps sequentially. Can't go back easily.
* Works especially well for: Items that stay consistently the same (such as home construction).

Construct likewise to LEGO: Construct within brief segments, obtain feedback along the way, modify during the overall process.
It works well for items with lots of change. For example, it works well when making apps or a website.

| Item | Of Waterfall | Of Agile |
|---|---|---|
| Its functionality | Phases | Small parts |
| Amendments | Difficult | Easy |
Discussions with other people | Not to such a degree | A quantity in discussion

* **Waterfall:** It is useful when you have a complete idea of the final product from the beginning.
* **Agile:** Use within processes when changes can occur or input is required during the process.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* The builder. They use resources and supplies for the building of the house as planned.
* The inspector. They thoroughly check throughout the house for certain problems, along with leaky roofs as well as crooked walls.
* The architect. The team develops the schedule beforehand, confirms the proper resources are accessible to all, and supervises the work as it proceeds.

The builder is on the job. Each house is under construction.
* The inspector tells the builder what problems to remedy.
The architect makes sure of everyone's teamwork together, and of the house's construction in time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Imagine building with LEGO:

* **IDE (like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm):** Think of it as your LEGO toolbox. It contains everything you need in one spot:
    * Various compartments to sort your bricks (code).
    * Handy tools to connect bricks effortlessly (write code more quickly).
    * A blueprint to guide your construction (understand how your code functions).

* **VCS (like Git and GitHub):** This is your LEGO instruction manual. It assists you in:
    * Keeping track of each step (monitor how your project evolves).
    * Reverting to a previous step if you make an error (undo changes).
    * Creating different versions of your build (develop various features).
    * Sharing your instructions with friends so they can join in the building (collaborate on code).

In summary, IDEs enable you to build more efficiently, while VCS helps you manage your project and collaborate with others. Both are essential for crafting amazing LEGO creations (or software)

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is both an art and a science focused on creating effective prompts that encourage desired responses from AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). This process involves thoughtfully crafting the input text to steer the model toward producing accurate, relevant, and helpful outputs. 
* **Why it matters:**
    * Enhances AI accuracy.
    * Provides greater control.
    * Accelerates problem-solving.
    * Minimizes AI errors.
    * Simplifies AI usage for everyone.
    * Conserves resources.
    * Contributes to AI improvement.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANSWER: 
Vague Prompt: "Write something about cats"
Improved Prompt: "Write a concise paragraph describing the main differences between domestic house cats and wild big cats, focusing on their physical characteristics and hunting behaviors."
The prompt about cats is too vague because it lacks specificity. It doesn't indicate what kind of information is desired, whether it's a story, a poem, or a list of facts. In contrast, the improved prompt clearly outlines a focused topic: the differences between domestic house cats and wild big cats, specifying that the response should concentrate on their physical characteristics and hunting behaviors. This clarity helps guide the AI to produce a relevant and concise paragraph, reducing ambiguity and ensuring a higher quality response that meets the user's expectations.
